# UBER using React Native

## Just make sure that you initialize your project like so

1.) clone the repository
2.) Install ---> npm install --global yarn  
3.) install --- > npm install --global expo-cli  
4.) Install dependencies --->  
[
    expo install react-native-gesture-handler;
    yarn add  @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack @reduxjs/toolkit react-native-dotenv react-native-elements react-native-gesture-handler react-native-google-places-autocomplete react-native-maps react-native-maps-directions react-native-safe-area-context react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-vector-icons react-native-web react-redux tailwind-react-native-classnames
]
5.) Create a GOOGLE_MAPS_APIKEY in 'https://cloud.google.com/'
6.) add Google Distance API, Google Distance Matrix API and Google Places API
7.) Create an .env file and add your GOOGLE_MAPS_APIKEY
8.) start project ---> expo start
9.) open browser on port: 19006 or use terminal options to open in ios or android simulator.
    -- Must have Xcode installed for Mac/Apple Computers to use simulator.
 Maybe rename the app id from com.<APP_NAME> to whatever you like
